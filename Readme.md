Practice backend and creating task command line interface.

## HOW TO RUN
1. Open your terminal and run npm i to download the modules.
2. Run cd Task to be in the right directory.
3. Run tsc Task.ts to convert it into a javascript file. You'll see task.js in the directory.
> [!NOTE]
> Typescript are not built for node.js so you'll need to convert it into a javascript file or just code in javascript. But that will beat the purpose of me learning Typescript.
> Also if someone knows how to import interfaces and use require on the Task.ts itself that would be great!

4. Finally, run node task.js to run the task-cli.
